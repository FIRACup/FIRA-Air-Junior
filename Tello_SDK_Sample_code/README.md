After Installing the Tello SDK (a guide is available the main readme), and connecting to the Tello's Wifi, you can run these sample code using python3.6. For example:

```
python3 tello_opencv_keyboard.py
```

In the tello_pygame_keboard.py sample you can view the robot's camera and control it by keyboard. To see the available keys you can check the source code. this code uses Pygame library to read the keyboard.

The second example is tello_opencv_keyboard.py, it has similar funtcion to the tello_pygame_keboard.py code, but it uses the opencv library to view the camera and scan the key board. you can use this file as a base and develop your image processing and computer vision software on it.
